## Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. Had problem using the system("cls") to clear the console. Using it would make the game buggy, e.g. console output becomes weird and user input would not be read. As such we found a solution in clearing the console using ANSI codes
2. Unable to complete save and load options because don't know how to apply C++ I/O Files knowledge to it. Will watch more guides ont this and understand the program properly
